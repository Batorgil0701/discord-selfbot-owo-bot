**Your account must have a valid owo profile already, this bot cant run efficiency on new generated accounts**
 You need a team (army) and some gems before start botting, thats because this bot is cant build a perfect account from zero **yet**

its normal your *bot* can sleep after some time thats for not get banned from owo

also there's a auto gem user, which is not perfect yet but works perfect

feel free to open issues
